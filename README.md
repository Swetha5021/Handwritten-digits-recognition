ANN model for handwritten digits recognition
Have you ever wondered how the human brain functions? There’s a good possibility you learned about it in school. The function of ANN is the same as that of neurons in the human nervous system. Let’s get this started.



Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are currently the most widely used Machine Learning techniques. These Neural Networks were first developed in the 1970s, but due to recent increases in computing power, they have become extremely popular, and they are now found almost everywhere. Neural Networks power the intelligent interface that keeps you engaged in every program you use.



ANNs are nonlinear statistical models that demonstrate a complex relationship between inputs and outputs in order to uncover a new pattern. Artificial neural networks are used for a range of applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, and medical diagnosis. The ANN is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms which has been trained and tested on the given dataset in order to compare and analyze.



The fact that ANN learns from sample data sets is a significant advantage. The most typical application of ANN is for random function approximation. With these types of technologies, one can arrive at solutions that specify the distribution in a cost-effective manner. ANN can also offer an output result based on a sample of data rather than the complete dataset. ANNs can be used to improve existing data analysis methods due to their high prediction capabilities.



The artificial neural networks approach is considered as the best way to develop systems for recognizing handwriting. Neural networks help to simulate how the human brain works when reading handwriting in a more simplified form. It allows machines to match and even exceed human capabilities at reading handwriting.



In this project, I have used digit_mnist dataset that has more than 60,000 plus training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and more than 10,000 images for testing. From the MNIST database, I have extracted 12,000 digits images for training and testing. So, 10 different classes are in the MNIST dataset. The HandWritten Digit Recognition model has been implemented using "relu" and "softmax" as activation layer. I have trained the model for 60 epochs and got an accuracy of 0.9789%.
